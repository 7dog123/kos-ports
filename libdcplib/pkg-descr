libdcplib is a Dreamcast "port" of the PLIB suite of game programming libraries.
Much of the library is essentially rewritten from its original version to make
it more closely map to the Dreamcast (instead of using OpenGL). The library
provides a relatively simple object-oriented C++ API of useful primitives for
writing games.

The Dreamcast version of this library only supports a small subset of the
primitives provided in current versions of PLIB. This port is based on a very
old version of PLIB and has not been updated in many years.
