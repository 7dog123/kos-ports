libmodplug is a library for decoding MOD-like tracker music formats. The music
formats supported by this library are much simpler than those for full PCM
music like Ogg Vorbis or MP3, but can still provide decent sequenced background
music for games.

This library, unlike those for Ogg Vorbis and MP3, does not provide sound output
directly. Look at the example included with KOS for more information about using
this library for your music.
