Vorbis is a public-domain, patent-free, lossy audio compression format usually
paired with the Ogg file format. libtremor is decoder library for the Vorbis
audio format that exclusively uses integer arithmetic, providing a potentially
more efficient library where floating-point operations are prohibitively
expensive.

This library is a mostly drop-in replacement for the liboggvorbisplay/libvorbis/
libogg stack.
