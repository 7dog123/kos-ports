GLdc is a partial implementation of OpenGL 1.2 for the Sega Dreamcast for use
with the KallistiOS SDK. The aim is to implement as much of OpenGL 1.2 as
possible, and to add additional features via extensions.

Note that this is not a full implementation of any version of OpenGL and is not
endorsed by or associated with the Khronos Group or SGI.
