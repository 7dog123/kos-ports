libjpeg is a freely available library that implements the JPEG image compression
and decompression algorithms. JPEG is a lossy image compression format that
does not support alpha channels.

The KOS port of this library includes a bit of additional functionality to
directly read JPEG images into textures or KOS platform-independent images.
