libtsunami is a C++ "scene graph" API, wrapped around libparallax. libtsunami
was actually designed as a part of the game Feet of Fury and was pulled directly
from its code (by its original authors) or designed around the same concepts
used in that game for managing the display.

libtsunami is an object-oriented C++ library that allows you to describe
drawable objects, animations, and triggers. All of these classes are reference
counted for ease of memory management.
