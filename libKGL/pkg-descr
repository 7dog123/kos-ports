KallistiGL is an OpenGL (tm) like library written for KOS. The current version
of this library implements much of version 1.1 of the OpenGL specification and
some additional functionality beyond that.

Note that this is not a full implementation of any version of OpenGL and is not
endorsed by or associated with the Khronos Group or SGI.
