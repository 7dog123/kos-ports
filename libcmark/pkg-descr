cmark is the C reference implementation of CommonMark, a rationalized 
version of Markdown syntax with a spec.

It provides a shared library (libcmark) with functions for parsing 
CommonMark documents to an abstract syntax tree (AST), manipulating 
the AST, and rendering the document to HTML, groff man, LaTeX, 
CommonMark, or an XML representation of the AST.
