libkosh is a *nix-like shell for KOS, in a convenient library form. This library
allows you to add a shell to your program with minimal effort(*). libkosh is
built on top of libconio, providing text-mode I/O.

(*): Minimal effort to add the shell, not minimal effort to find a reason for a
     shell in the first place. ;-)
