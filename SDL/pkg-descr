SDL is a cross-platform development library, primarily focused at developing
games. SDL is written in C and has bindings (not included here) for many other
programming languages. SDL has been used by many games, including commercial
ones. SDL provides abstractions for video, sound, joystick/gamepad handling,
keyboard input, and threads.

The SDL version here is of the older 1.2.x line. The 2.x series has not been
ported to the Dreamcast.
